## Important validation status

The source has passed local structural checks, relative-import checks, source-reference checks, immutable-audit checks, transaction-reference checks and a simulated Build 5/6-to-Build 8 SQLite migration. The migration preserved representative legacy records, created 50 application tables, returned `PRAGMA integrity_check = ok`, and produced no foreign-key violations.

This environment does not contain Flutter, Dart, Visual Studio, Inno Setup or a Windows runner. Therefore these release gates remain unverified:

```text
flutter pub get
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build windows --release
Inno Setup compilation
Installed/portable Windows launch
Live SMTP, WebDAV, WhatsApp, updater, printer and scanner tests
```

`pubspec.lock` is intentionally absent because the inherited lock represented the failed dependency graph. The Windows workflow regenerates it with `flutter pub get`, verifies the resolved dependency tree and includes the generated lock in the full-source artifact. Commit the generated lock after the first successful Flutter-capable validation run.

The source checkpoint is suitable for GitHub CI review. It is **not approved as a distributable Windows release** until every workflow step passes.

## Build on Windows

Install Flutter 3.44.5 and Visual Studio with **Desktop development with C++**, then run:

```powershell
flutter pub get
./tool/bootstrap_windows.ps1
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build windows --release
./tool/package_windows.ps1
```

Build the installer with Inno Setup 6:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" installer\airmonlink_business_manager.iss
```

## Local data

The SQLite database remains in the Windows application-support directory, outside the installation folder. Backups and exports use:

```text
Documents/Airmonlink Business Manager/
├── Backups/
└── Exports/
```

The installer does not include a deletion routine for customer business data.
